     <p>By default, the console of Google Chrome takes exactly half of the screen, but you can adjust the ratio easily via the slider on the middle and the browser will remember the modification the next time you open the console. If you want to focus on a specific element, you can simply highlight it with your mouse and then right-click on it > Inspect.</p>
